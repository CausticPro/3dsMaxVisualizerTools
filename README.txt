This repository includes scripts and related tools for use with Caustic Visualizer.

Caustic Visualizer is a 3D rendering tool from Imagination Technologies, you can find out
more about it at http://www.caustic.com

The tools and scripts here are public and NOT part of the standard Visualizer release.

TO use them, just install in the usual way for your host software (e.g., 3ds Max maxscript
files would be placed in the standard location, Maya .mel or Python files similarly). Or just
locally copy the repo and include the local repo-copy directories in your application's path (e.g., the MAYA_ENV_PATH variable).
